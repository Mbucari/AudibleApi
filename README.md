Audible API in C#

Implementation of an Audible API in C#. Aside from the goal of having this be pure C#, the focus on this project was to have it

1) fully integratable into other software
2) fully testable and tested

Thanks to these other Audible APIs which I used for reference and whose authors were very responsive and helpful with questions:
